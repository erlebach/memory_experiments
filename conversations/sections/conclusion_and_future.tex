\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have presented a unified state-space framework that bridges cognitive memory models and modern neural architectures. Our key contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A general mathematical formulation encompassing diverse memory systems
\item Flexible implementation supporting hybrid architectures
\item Comprehensive evaluation across cognitive and computational tasks
\item Novel LoRA-based adaptation for inference-time memory learning
\end{itemize}

Future directions include extending to online learning scenarios, developing lifelong memory capabilities, and unifying with graph-based memory models. The framework opens new possibilities for interpretable AI systems that combine cognitive plausibility with computational efficiency.
